Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
    Threat modeling is like organizing a large outdoor event, where you anticipate and prepare for various scenarios such as weather, unexpected guest numbers, or technical difficulties to ensure the event runs smoothly.


What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
    The four key questions to guide threat modeling are: "What are we building?", "What can go wrong?", "What are we going to do about it?", and "Did we do a good job?".


You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
    As the project lead, I would explain to the team that threat modeling is a good approach to identify and mitigate potential security risks early in our application's development.
