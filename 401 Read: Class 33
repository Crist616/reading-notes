How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
    Threat hunting is searching for hidden threats in a network, while penetration testing is testing systems for vulnerabilities to prevent potential attacks.

What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
    The primary objective of Threat Hunting is to identify and mitigate undetected threats in a network or system.

Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
    I would advocate for starting Threat Hunting activities by emphasizing their value in identifying and mitigating hidden threats that might not be detected by our existing security measures.
