You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
     As a Malware Analyst my job is to study computer viruses to understand how they work and find ways to protect against them. 

What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
    The six steps of the Malware Analysis process are Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned. A simple mnemonic to remember them is "PICERL".

You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?
      I would conduct static (offline) analysis first because it allows for examining the malware without executing it, reducing the risk and providing initial insights into its functionality.
