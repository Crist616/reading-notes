PKI, or Public Key Infrastructure, consists of three main components:
    1- Public Key Cryptography
    2- Certificate Authority (CA)
    3- Registration Authority (RA)


How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
    PKI is like using special locks and keys when you send secret messages online. When you visit a website, your computer and the site create a secure connection, like sealing a letter in a locked box. Certificate Authorities make sure the locks are trustworthy, so your information stays private during its journey.


What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture
  One main weakness of the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) architecture is the reliance on the security of private keys. If a user's private key is compromised or falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to unauthorized access
