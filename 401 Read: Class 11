How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?
      A SOAR solution enhances a security team's efficiency by automating tasks. It provides real-time insights for informed decision making. Ultimately, SOAR optimizes security operations by combining automation, orchestration, and response capabilities in a unified platform.


Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.
      A SOAR solution seamlessly integrates into the Incident Response process by automating routine tasks, facilitating real-time collaboration among security team members. It accelerates incident detection and response. Through its adaptive capabilities, a SOAR solution becomes a central component, enhancing the overall effectiveness and agility of the incident Response lifecycle.
