What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
    CIDR notation is the IP address followed by a forward slash ("/") and a number, which represents the length of the network.
    CIDR block are groups of IP addresses that share the same network prefix length (EX: /24 or /16)

How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
    An IPv4 address consists of 4 octets, also known as 4 bytes or 32 bits. Each octet is separated by a dot, and it can represent a decimal number ranging from 0 to 255.

Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
      Setting binary aside, an octet can go from 0 to 255 making a total of 256 possible values.

What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
      The final digit after the / specifies the size of the network and determines how many IP addresses are available within that network.

How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
       This CIDR block as 32 bits, then we have to make a calculation, so 2^(32-24) = 256, then in this CIDR block we have 256 ip adresses. 
                                                                          2^8 = 256

In your own words, describe network segmentation.
        Network segmentation is dividing the computer network in to smaller, isolated segments.

Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
        I do not agree with the statement, defence in depth is one of the reasons that shows how important network segmentation is. 

what is a  a screened subnet?
        Is a security architecture that uses security devices to create a zone between an organization's trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
        Physical Security devices.
