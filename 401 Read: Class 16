Lessons Learned from the Capital One Data Breach 

What were the three commands used for the attack?
    The commands used on the attack where:
       - Get Credentials - First command when executed obtained security credentials known as ****-WAF-Role account (an IAM account) for an elevated role access AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
       - List Buckets - Second command, when executed, used the security credentials *****-WAF-Role account to list files and folders (aka S3 buckets)
       - Download Files - Third command, when executed used the *****-WAF-Role account to download files that were accessible by the credentials.

What misconfiguration of AWS components allowed the attacker to access sensitive data?
    The attacker did acess the data by exploring excessive high-risk permissions by a user. 


What are two of the AWS Governance practices that could have prevented such attack?
    Such attack might be prevented by review all acess paths and permissions and by ensuring each aplication, EC2 instance has its only IAM role, not sharing roles across applications.
