Explain how a cross-site scripting attack works in non-technical terms.
    A cross-site scripting attack is like tricking a website into delivering a harmful note to your computer, which then causes it to reveal sensitive information or do something it shouldn't.

What are the three types of XSS attacks?
    The three types of XSS attacks are: 1- Stored, where harmful code is saved on a website, 2- Reflected, where the code is directly sent back to a user's browser, and 3- DOM-based, where the attack happens within the user's browser through the webpage's structure itself.

If an attacker successfully exploits a XSS vulnerability, what malicious actions would they be able to perform?
    If an attacker exploits a cross-site scripting vulnerability, they can steal sensitive information, impersonate the user, or manipulate what the user sees on the website.

What are some security controls that can be implemented to prevent XSS attacks?
    To prevent XSS attacks, use strategies like validating and sanitizing user input, implementing Content Security Policy (CSP), and using secure programming practices to handle data safely.
